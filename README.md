# g-code-Composer
The gcomp utility runs under CygWin. It may be used to compose a final GCode assembling elementary parts, moving each of them in the desidred position, remapping the Smax power level and defining the number of passes per each figure. The input parts can be obtained by exporting the LaserGRBL sheet into a *.nc GCode file. Start reading the brief PDF Manual here included.
